# View Mode Toggle & Export Confirmation Enhancement

## Features Added

### 1. 🌍 View Mode Toggle in Reports Page

**What**: Added "This Month" and "All Time" toggle to Reports page (same as Dashboard)

**UI Location**: Top-right of Reports page header
```
Financial Reports                [📅 This Month] [🌍 All Time]
```

**Behavior**:
- **This Month**: Shows month/year selectors and period-specific data
- **All Time**: Hides selectors, calculates all-time totals from all transactions

### 2. ✅ Export Confirmation Dialogs

**What**: Added confirmation popup before exporting CSV or PDF

**Shown Information**:
- 📊 Export type (CSV or PDF)
- 📅 Period being exported (e.g., "October 2025" or "All Time")
- 📝 Number of transactions
- 💰 Total Income
- 💸 Total Expenses

**Example Confirmation**:
```
📄 Export PDF Report

Period: October 2025
Transactions: 15
Income: ₹30000.00
Expenses: ₹5000.00

Do you want to proceed with the export?
```

**User Can**:
- ✅ Click "OK" to proceed with export
- ❌ Click "Cancel" to abort export
- Shows toast notification if cancelled

### 3. 🔄 Smart Export Logic

**Current Month Mode**:
- Exports only selected month/year
- Filename: `transactions_10_2025.csv` or `transactions_10_2025.pdf`

**All Time Mode**:
- Exports ALL transactions regardless of date
- Filename: `transactions_all_time.csv` or `transactions_all_time.pdf`
- API called without month/year parameters

## User Experience Flow

### Viewing Reports

**This Month (Default)**:
1. User sees month/year selectors
2. Select desired month and year
3. Data loads for that specific period
4. Export buttons say "Export CSV" / "Export PDF"

**All Time**:
1. User clicks "🌍 All Time" button
2. Month/year selectors hide
3. Data shows ALL transactions ever
4. Export buttons say "Export CSV (All Time)" / "Export PDF (All Time)"

### Exporting Reports

**Step 1**: Click export button (CSV or PDF)

**Step 2**: Confirmation dialog appears showing:
```
📊 Export CSV Report

Period: All Time
Transactions: 142
Income: ₹450000.00
Expenses: ₹125000.00

Do you want to proceed with the export?
```

**Step 3a**: User clicks "OK"
- Export proceeds
- File downloads
- Success toast notification

**Step 3b**: User clicks "Cancel"
- Export cancelled
- "Export cancelled" toast notification
- No file downloaded

## Benefits

### 1. Prevents Accidental Exports
- User must confirm before downloading
- Can verify they're exporting the right period
- Shows summary before committing

### 2. Clear Period Indication
- No confusion about what's being exported
- Shows "All Time" vs specific month
- Transaction count visible

### 3. Consistent UX
- Reports page now matches Dashboard
- Same toggle buttons
- Same view mode concept

### 4. Better Control
- Easy to switch between monthly and all-time views
- One click to see complete financial history
- No need to manually select date range

## Technical Implementation

### All-Time Calculation (Client-Side)
```javascript
// Get all transactions
const transactionsRes = await transactionAPI.getAll();
const allTransactions = transactionsRes.data;

// Calculate totals
const totalIncome = allTransactions
  .filter(t => t.type === 'income')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);

const totalExpenses = allTransactions
  .filter(t => t.type === 'expense')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);
```

### Export Confirmation Logic
```javascript
const confirmed = window.confirm(
  `📊 Export CSV Report\n\n` +
  `Period: ${periodDesc}\n` +
  `Transactions: ${transactionCount}\n` +
  `Income: ₹${totalIncome.toFixed(2)}\n` +
  `Expenses: ₹${totalExpenses.toFixed(2)}\n\n` +
  `Do you want to proceed?`
);

if (!confirmed) {
  toast.info('Export cancelled');
  return;
}
```

### Conditional Export
```javascript
if (viewMode === 'all-time') {
  // Export all transactions (no date filter)
  const response = await reportAPI.exportCSV({});
  filename = 'transactions_all_time.csv';
} else {
  // Export specific month
  const response = await reportAPI.exportCSV({
    month: selectedMonth,
    year: selectedYear
  });
  filename = `transactions_${selectedMonth}_${selectedYear}.csv`;
}
```
