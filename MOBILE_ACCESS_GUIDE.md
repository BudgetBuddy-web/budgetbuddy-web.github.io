## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Access from Phone?

1. **Check WiFi**: Make sure both devices are on the same network
   ```bash
   # On computer, check connection:
   ip addr show
   ```

2. **Check Firewall**: 
   ```bash
   # On computer, check if ports are blocked:
   sudo ufw status
   ```

3. **Restart Servers**: If needed, restart both servers:
   ```bash
   # Kill old processes
   lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   
   # Start backend
   cd /home/david/HTML/BudgetBuddy/server && node server.js &
   
   # Start frontend
   cd /home/david/HTML/BudgetBuddy/client && npm start
   ```

4. **Check IP Address**: If IP changed, get new one:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

### Firewall Issues?

If you have a firewall, allow ports 3000 and 5000:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp
```

## 🌍 Access from Outside Your Home Network

### Option 1: Port Forwarding (Advanced)
1. Login to your router
2. Forward ports 3000 and 5000 to your computer's IP (10.3.4.22)
3. Find your public IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com
4. Access via: http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000

⚠️ **Security Warning**: This exposes your app to the internet. Use strong passwords!

### Option 2: ngrok (Easier & Safer)
```bash
# Install ngrok
sudo snap install ngrok

# Start tunnel for frontend
ngrok http 3000
```

This gives you a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
