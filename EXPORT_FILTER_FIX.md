# Export Filter Fix

## Issue
When selecting a specific month (e.g., November/month 11) in the Reports page and exporting to CSV or PDF, all transactions were being exported instead of just the selected month's transactions.

## Root Cause
The backend export functions (`exportCSV` and `exportPDF`) were expecting `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters, but the frontend was sending `month` and `year` parameters. This mismatch caused the backend to skip date filtering and export all user transactions.

## Solution

### Backend Changes (`server/controllers/report.controller.js`)

#### Modified `exportCSV` function:
- Now accepts both `month`/`year` and `startDate`/`endDate` parameters
- When `month` and `year` are provided:
  - Converts them to start/end of month date range
  - Filters transactions within that specific month
- Maintains backward compatibility with `startDate`/`endDate` parameters

#### Modified `exportPDF` function:
- Same logic as CSV export
- Accepts `month`/`year` parameters
- Converts to proper date range for MongoDB query
- Filters transactions correctly

### Technical Details

**Month/Year to Date Range Conversion:**
```javascript
const targetMonth = parseInt(month);
const targetYear = parseInt(year);
const startOfMonth = new Date(targetYear, targetMonth - 1, 1);
const endOfMonth = new Date(targetYear, targetMonth, 0, 23, 59, 59);
query.date = { $gte: startOfMonth, $lte: endOfMonth };
```

**Query Logic:**
1. If `month` AND `year` provided → Filter by that specific month
2. Else if `startDate` OR `endDate` provided → Use those dates (legacy support)
3. Else → Export all transactions (for "All Time" view)

## Behavior After Fix

### Monthly Export (e.g., November 2025):
- User selects "This Month" view
- Selects November 2025 from dropdown
- Clicks "Export CSV" or "Export PDF"
- **Result:** Only November 2025 transactions are exported

### All Time Export:
- User selects "All Time" view
- Clicks "Export CSV" or "Export PDF"
- **Result:** All transactions are exported (no date filter)

## Files Modified
- `/server/controllers/report.controller.js` - Added month/year filtering logic to both export functions

## Testing Checklist
✅ Export CSV with specific month selected → Only that month's data
✅ Export PDF with specific month selected → Only that month's data
✅ Export CSV in "All Time" view → All transactions
✅ Export PDF in "All Time" view → All transactions
✅ Confirmation dialog shows correct transaction count before export
✅ Filename reflects the period (e.g., `transactions_11_2025.csv`)
